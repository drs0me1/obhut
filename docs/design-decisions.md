# Design Decisions

## Design decisions and rationale

This document records the *why* behind non-obvious choices in
`install.sh`, so future changes don't accidentally "fix" something that
was deliberate. Entries are derived from reading the script's own inline
comments plus structural inference from the 2026-07-27 audit
(`SECURITY_REVIEW.md`).

### DD-1: Atomic staging-chain swap for firewall rules

- **Decision:** Firewall updates build a brand-new, randomly named chain
  fully, then splice it in and only afterward tear down the old one,
  instead of flushing and rebuilding the canonical chain in place.
- **Context:** `install.sh:1336-1390` (`create_staging_chain`,
  `activate_staging_chain`) and the mangle-table equivalent.
- **Rationale:** Flushing `MASTER-DOCKER`/`MASTER-TS-FORWARD` in place
  would leave a window where the chain is empty — either briefly
  fail-open (dangerous) or briefly fail-closed (drops exit-node traffic).
  The staging-chain-then-rename approach keeps the previous, complete rule
  set live until the new one is fully ready.
- **Trade-off:** More complex code (stale-chain cleanup, `$RANDOM`-based
  naming) than a simple flush-and-rebuild, but avoids any exposure window.

### DD-2: Canonical-bundle SHA256 manifest for reconcile

- **Decision:** Managed config files (state, dnsmasq, Caddy) are copied
  into `/usr/local/share/master-stack/` alongside a `SHA256SUMS` manifest;
  reconcile compares live files against these canonical copies rather than
  re-generating and diffing content on every check.
- **Context:** `install.sh:2235-2268` (`canonical_bundle_ok`).
- **Rationale:** A cheap, atomic-manifest-based comparison is faster than
  re-deriving expected file content every 5 minutes, and it gives a single
  place (the manifest) to validate that the *whole* canonical bundle is
  self-consistent before trusting any individual file comparison.
- **Trade-off:** Any manual edit to the live config files (not the
  canonical copies) is treated as drift and reverted — see DD-3.

### DD-3: Reconcile reverts operator edits instead of merging them

- **Decision:** When live firewall/dnsmasq/Caddy config differs from the
  canonical copy, reconcile restores the canonical version rather than
  attempting to detect or preserve manual changes.
- **Rationale:** Merging arbitrary manual edits safely is not tractable
  for this kind of security-sensitive configuration; a deterministic
  "known-good state always wins" model is simpler to reason about and
  guarantees the fail-closed security posture can't erode over time.
- **Trade-off:** Operators cannot make ad hoc persistent changes without
  either editing `install.sh` and re-running it, or (not currently
  implemented) using an explicit opt-out. Flagged as **H2** in
  `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` for better operator-facing documentation of this
  behavior.

### DD-4: `PartOf` fate-sharing between core daemons and managed units

- **Decision:** `docker-tailscale-fw.service`, `master-compose.service`,
  and (optionally) `caddy.service` declare `PartOf=docker.service` and/or
  `PartOf=tailscaled.service`.
- **Rationale:** If the underlying daemon (Docker or Tailscale) is
  stopped, the firewall/Compose/Caddy state built on top of it is no
  longer meaningful and should not be left running against a torn-down
  dependency.
- **Trade-off:** A routine restart of `docker` or `tailscaled` cascades
  into stopping and restarting the entire dependent stack — a real
  operational surprise, flagged as **H3** in `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`.

### DD-5: Reconcile avoids restarting core daemons synchronously

- **Decision:** `master-network-reconcile.service` does not sit in the
  `After=` graph of the units it manages, and never issues a synchronous
  `systemctl restart docker`/`tailscaled` from within its own execution.
- **Context:** Comment at `install.sh:3462-3467`.
- **Rationale:** Doing so from inside a unit that is itself triggered via
  `OnFailure=` from those same units' dependents would risk a systemd
  self-ordering wait/cycle. Core daemon recovery is left to their own
  built-in restart policies; reconcile only acts once they're confirmed
  active.

### DD-6: Fail-closed masking for optional DNS/Caddy services

- **Decision:** `dnsmasq` and `caddy` are installed already `mask`ed, and
  only `unmask`ed after their generated configuration has been validated
  (`dnsmasq --test`, `caddy validate`).
- **Rationale:** Prevents the packaged default (wildcard-listening)
  configuration from ever being reachable — even transiently across a
  reboot mid-install — before the Tailnet-only configuration is confirmed
  good.
- **Trade-off:** Adds bookkeeping (capturing and restoring prior
  mask/enable/active state in the `EXIT` trap) but is necessary for the
  security guarantee to hold across a failed or interrupted install.

### DD-7: wg-easy admin/peer setup is manual (superseded, 2026-07-27)

- **Original decision (r8 and earlier):** First-run wg-easy admin
  credentials were supplied via a root-only `/run`-based env file and a
  Compose override (`restart: "no"`), then the container was
  force-recreated without that override once the bootstrap was verified,
  so the secret never persisted in the container's running environment.
  This closed the credential-exposure window as tightly as the
  Compose/Docker model allowed, but meant a script failure in the narrow
  window between database creation and the bootstrap marker being written
  left a hard-to-recover dead-end state (**M6** in `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`).
- **New decision (2026-07-27):** At the user's explicit request, the
  entire unattended-bootstrap subsystem was removed. `install.sh` now only
  provisions the wg-easy container and its infrastructure (port, volumes,
  network, firewall rules); the admin account is created manually through
  wg-easy's own web UI on first access — the same model already used for
  Portainer and SFTPGo. See `install.sh` Stage 0 (no more admin prompt),
  Stage 5 (no more bootstrap-apply-verify-scrub sequence), and Stage 7
  (the postcondition is now informational only, feeding the existing
  "complete setup manually" message in the final summary rather than
  failing the install).
- **Rationale:** The user considers wg-easy's admin credentials out of
  scope for the installer to manage at all — consistent with how every
  other service's admin account already works. This also deletes an
  entire secret-handling subsystem (bootstrap env files, container secret
  scrubbing, marker-gated rerun safety), directly resolving **M6** and
  reducing the script by 248 lines.
- **Trade-off:** The removed marker also recorded which public IP was
  baked into already-configured wg-easy peer configs. Without it,
  `state.env`'s `WG_ENDPOINT_HOST` is simply overwritten with the current
  public IPv4 on every `install.sh` run (see `install.sh` Stage 4). The
  reconcile timer still detects a public-IP change that happens *between*
  its own 5-minute checks, but a change that happens between two separate
  `install.sh` reruns is no longer specifically flagged — reconcile will
  just record the new IP as if it were always correct. Operators should
  manually verify existing peer configs after any public-IP change
  followed by a re-run of `install.sh`.

### DD-8: Docker daemon DNS hardcoded to public resolvers

- **Decision:** `/etc/docker/daemon.json`'s `dns` key is forced to
  `["1.1.1.1", "1.0.0.1"]`, merged in via `jq` so other daemon settings are
  preserved.
- **Context:** `install.sh:1014-1039`.
- **Rationale:** If Tailscale's MagicDNS/accept-dns rewrites the host's
  `resolv.conf` to `100.100.100.100`, a container on the default bridge
  that inherits it would have its DNS queries routed through the
  restrictive `FORWARD` firewall path and dropped. Forcing stable public
  resolvers for Docker avoids that failure mode independent of host DNS
  configuration.
- **Trade-off:** Host-level and container-level name resolution now follow
  two different paths on the same machine (see **L4** in
  `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`).
- **Confirmed live (2026-07-28):** on a real installed host with Tailscale
  DNS override active (`/etc/resolv.conf` → `100.100.100.100`), a
  container's own `resolv.conf` correctly showed `127.0.0.11` (Docker's
  embedded resolver) forwarding to `1.1.1.1`/`1.0.0.1`, and
  `nslookup ... 1.1.1.1` from inside a container succeeded with both A and
  AAAA records — the firewall does not block this egress path.

### DD-9: Everything lives in one script, deployed via heredocs

- **Decision:** All generated helper scripts (firewall, reconcile,
  recovery, IP-refresh, Caddy env) are embedded as heredocs inside
  `install.sh` rather than shipped as separate files.
- **Rationale (inferred):** Keeps the installer a single, copy-pasteable /
  curl-pipeable artifact with no additional download or packaging step.
- **Trade-off:** These embedded scripts are invisible to `shellcheck
  install.sh` / `bash -n install.sh` (see **H4** in `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`),
  and the file is large and harder to navigate/test as a result.
  `scripts/lint-embedded-scripts.sh` (static analysis) and `test/*.bats`
  (unit tests for a growing subset of pure-logic functions) now mitigate
  this without abandoning the single-file model — see `docs/testing.md`
  for what's covered and what remains open.

### DD-10: `wg-easy`'s WireGuard kernel module is loaded independently of Tailscale (2026-07-27)

- **Decision:** Instead of granting `wg-easy` the `SYS_MODULE` capability
  (so it could `modprobe wireguard` itself if needed), `install.sh` now
  runs a standalone `modprobe wireguard` on the **host** in Stage 4 (next
  to the `/data/wg-easy/config` directory creation), mirroring the
  existing `modprobe tun` step already used for Tailscale in Stage 2
  (`install.sh:770-774`) — same best-effort pattern (warn on failure,
  never hard-fail the install), but a separate, independent call.
- **Context/clarification:** `tun` and `wireguard` are two unrelated
  Linux kernel modules — `tun` is a generic virtual-network-device driver
  used by many userspace VPN engines (including, very likely, Tailscale's
  own `tailscaled`, which brings up `tailscale0` via a TUN device plus its
  bundled userspace WireGuard engine, evidenced by the script's own
  `modprobe tun` — not `modprobe wireguard` — in Stage 2); `wireguard` is
  the in-kernel WireGuard protocol implementation that wg-easy's `wg0`
  interface uses instead. Loading one has no effect on, and no dependency
  relationship with, the other. All containers and the host share a
  single Linux kernel (unlike filesystem/network namespaces, a kernel
  module is not container-scoped), which is exactly why granting a
  container the ability to load one (`SYS_MODULE`) reaches further outside
  container isolation than almost anything else a container normally
  does — and why removing it here was worth the trade-off below.
- **Rationale:** Resolves **H1** in `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` — wg-easy now
  runs with only `NET_ADMIN`, no `SYS_MODULE`, no `/lib/modules` mount.
- **Hardening added:** Two follow-up questions from the user — "can we
  guarantee this," "should it persist across reboots," "does it risk
  Tailscale or other WireGuard services" — led to two more changes in the
  same Stage 4 block: (1) `/etc/modules-load.d/wg-easy.conf` (content:
  `wireguard`) makes the load persistent across reboots via
  `systemd-modules-load.service`, not just the current session; (2) a
  functional probe (`ip link add wg-easy-probe0 type wireguard` then
  delete) replaces reliance on `modprobe`'s exit code — this correctly
  detects a kernel where WireGuard is compiled in directly (`=y`, no
  loadable module at all), which would otherwise make `modprobe` report a
  false "not found" warning. No risk to Tailscale or other services: the
  kernel module is orthogonal to Tailscale's TUN + userspace path, and
  wg-easy is the only kernel-WireGuard consumer on this host — modules
  don't share state or interfere with each other once loaded.
- **Trade-off / open risk:** This assumes the host kernel can provide
  WireGuard support at all (module or built-in) — true for a stock Debian
  13 kernel and now functionally verified at install time (not just
  assumed), but the actual target server hasn't been tested by this
  assistant (no access to it). Requires a real functional test after this
  change to confirm end-to-end (wg-easy actually bringing up `wg0`).
- **Open alternative (not implemented):** Running WireGuard fully in
  userspace inside the container (e.g. `boringtun` or `wireguard-go`)
  would remove any kernel-module dependency at all — no `SYS_MODULE`
  ever, regardless of host kernel state, at a modest throughput cost
  (`boringtun` is typically ~80–90% of kernel WireGuard speed on modern
  hardware, likely immaterial for this server's use case). Not pursued
  because stock wg-easy doesn't officially support a userspace backend;
  doing this would mean forking/customizing the image, a larger effort
  than the host-modprobe approach above.

### DD-11: UDP GRO forwarding is applied once, not continuously reconciled (2026-07-28)

- **Decision:** `tailscale-udp-gro.service`'s one-time Stage 2 setup
  (helper script + oneshot systemd unit, re-applied at every boot) is
  kept, but the ~54 lines that used to make `master-network-reconcile`
  detect and repair GRO drift every 5 minutes were removed.
- **Context:** `install.sh:830-940` (setup); the removed reconcile logic
  previously lived around where `all_critical_state_healthy()` is now
  defined in the `master-network-reconcile` heredoc.
- **Rationale:** UDP GRO forwarding is a pure throughput optimization for
  Tailscale's exit-node traffic — it never affects connectivity, only
  performance under load. It was already excluded from
  `all_critical_state_healthy()`, so its drift never affected any
  pass/fail postcondition; the only thing continuous reconciliation
  bought was auto-fixing a drift that isn't caused by a reboot (ethtool
  NIC flags don't persist across reboots on their own, which is why the
  one-time, per-boot setup step still exists and is not being removed).
  Resolves **L3** in `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`.
- **Trade-off:** If GRO settings are reset by something other than a
  reboot (rare — e.g. a NIC driver hot-reload, or certain virtualization
  live-migration events), the script no longer notices or fixes this
  within 5 minutes. It will be re-applied on the next reboot or the next
  `install.sh` re-run instead. Accepted by the user as a reasonable trade
  given GRO is throughput-only.
- **Side effect caught during this change:** two variables
  (`ETHTOOL_BIN`, `CURRENT_WAN6_IF`) inside the `master-network-reconcile`
  heredoc were only ever used by the removed GRO check, and became dead
  code. `shellcheck install.sh` did **not** flag them, since it cannot see
  inside heredoc bodies (see **H4**) — this had to be caught by manual
  review, a concrete illustration of why H4 is a real gap and not just a
  theoretical one.
- **Amended 2026-07-29 (first pass) — the unit is checked again.**
  Reconcile reads `tailscale-udp-gro.service`'s `ActiveState` and restarts
  it (15-minute cooldown via the existing `restart_budget_available`
  stamp) when it is not active.
- **Amended again 2026-07-29 (second pass) — the flags are checked too,
  because live testing showed the unit check alone proves nothing about
  throughput.** The fault-injection run made the gap concrete: after
  `systemctl stop tailscale-udp-gro`, `ethtool -k eth0` still reported
  `rx-udp-gro-forwarding: on`. Stopping the unit does not undo the flags,
  so a unit-only check verifies bookkeeping rather than the optimization
  it exists to protect. Reconcile now also runs `gro_flags_ok()` against
  `CURRENT_WAN4_IF` (already computed for address-drift detection) and
  repairs on either signal. `ETHTOOL_BIN` is reinstated for this — the
  variable this decision originally noted as dead code.
  - **What is still *not* re-added:** the removed logic polled both the
    IPv4 and IPv6 default interfaces and reimplemented the helper's apply
    path. The new check reads the IPv4 WAN interface only and never
    applies anything itself — repair is always `systemctl restart`, so
    systemd stays the single execution path and the unit's state keeps
    reflecting reality. That is why this is ~15 lines rather than the ~54
    that were removed.
  - **Everything the check cannot evaluate is treated as healthy:** no
    `ethtool` binary, no detected WAN interface, a driver that does not
    report the two features, or one that reports them `[fixed]`. This
    mirrors the helper, which exits successfully in exactly those cases,
    so the two cannot disagree and produce a restart loop.
  - Reported as `gro_flags=` alongside `gro_unit=` in `--check`; both stay
    outside `all_critical_state_healthy()` and the exit code.
- **The gap that motivated the amendment.** The unit is `Type=oneshot`
  with `Restart=no`. If it fails at boot — the exact case Stage 2 already
  anticipates, where the network is not ready yet and `install.sh` prints
  "reconcile yeniden deneyecek" and calls `reset-failed` — then nothing
  retried it. It stayed `failed` until the next reboot or `install.sh`
  re-run. The unit file's own comment claimed reconcile retried every five
  minutes, which had been **false since this decision removed that code**;
  that stale comment is corrected in the same change.
- **Placement detail worth knowing.** The repair runs *before* the
  `all_critical_state_healthy()` early `exit 0`, because otherwise a
  healthy system would return before ever reaching it. It is still
  excluded from that function and from the exit code: a GRO failure is
  throughput-only and must not make `--check` report an unhealthy host.
  It is reported as `gro_unit=` in `--check` output.

### DD-12: wg-easy's pending first-run setup must never gate Stage 7 or `--check` (2026-07-28)

- **Decision:** `check_compose_runtime()`'s `/setup`-redirect branch (the
  case where wg-easy's admin account hasn't been created yet) sets
  `WG_CONFIGURATION_INVALID=1` but deliberately **not** `runtime_ok=1` —
  so it doesn't count toward `COMPOSE_RUNTIME_DRIFTED` or
  `all_critical_state_healthy()`. The other two branches in the same
  `if`/`elif` chain (WireGuard port mismatch after setup, netfilter
  drift) are unaffected and still count as real drift.
- **Context:** `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` finding **H6**, found via the second
  live Tier 3 install attempt (2026-07-28) — every fresh install failed
  at Stage 7's `master-network-reconcile --check` postcondition call
  specifically because of this branch, before this fix.
- **Rationale:** A pending wg-easy setup is the *expected* state of every
  fresh install (M6 made it fully manual) — not a real problem
  `--check`/Stage 7 should ever fail on. The periodic reconcile timer's
  own, separate `RECOVERY_FAILED` reporting (keyed directly on
  `WG_CONFIGURATION_INVALID`, further down the script) still surfaces it
  to operators via journald on every cycle until the human completes
  setup — this decision only affects the two callers of
  `all_critical_state_healthy()` (`--check` mode and the non-check mode's
  own early-exit), not operator visibility.
- **Trade-off:** None identified — this is a strict correction of an
  oversight in how **M6** interacted with a check written before it.
  Anyone extending `check_compose_runtime()` with a new "expected,
  non-actionable" state should follow the same pattern: track it via a
  separate flag consumed by `RECOVERY_FAILED`, not `runtime_ok`.

### DD-13: Reconcile's disk-space check reports but never auto-repairs (2026-07-28)

- **Decision:** `disk_space_ok()` (checks the filesystem backing
  `$DOWNLOADS_PATH`, now persisted in `state.env`) is wired into
  `all_critical_state_healthy()` and the final postcondition
  re-verification block, but there is **no** repair action anywhere in
  the script for low disk space.
- **Context:** Added after a user-requested final architecture review
  considering the server's actual workload (continuous
  downloading/extraction) — previously the one realistic operational
  failure mode reconcile had zero visibility into.
- **Rationale:** Every other reconcile-managed drift has a safe,
  well-defined repair (reapply a sysctl, rewrite a firewall chain,
  restart a container from a known-good image). There is no equivalent
  safe action for "disk is full" — deleting files would mean guessing at
  which of the user's downloaded/extracted data is safe to remove, which
  this project has no basis to do automatically. The check exists purely
  to surface the condition early (via `--check`'s exit code and the
  periodic timer's own failed-unit visibility), not to fix it.
- **Trade-off:** Unlike most other critical-state components, this one
  will not resolve itself on the next cycle — it stays failed until a
  human frees space or grows the disk. Considered and rejected: an
  automatic prune of the oldest files in the downloads tree (too risky/
  presumptuous to implement without the user's explicit, scoped
  instruction on what's safe to delete).

## Rejected Alternatives

- **Using `nftables` directly instead of `iptables`/`ip6tables`:** not
  pursued; Debian 13's `iptables` package already provides the
  nftables-backed `iptables`/`ip6tables` compatibility binaries, so the
  existing rule-based logic works without a rewrite. **Partially
  verified 2026-07-28:** the host's own `iptables`/`ip6tables` do run
  through the nftables backend (`nf_tables`/`nft_compat` kernel modules)
  — discovered as the root cause of the **H1** regression, where
  wg-easy's container uses the **legacy** backend instead (needing its
  own separate `ip6_tables`/`ip6table_nat` modules the host's nft-backed
  usage never loads). Not verified beyond this one concrete case whether
  anything else in the script assumes one backend over the other.
- **Merging operator config changes into the canonical bundle instead of
  reverting them (see DD-3):** rejected as intractable to do safely for
  security-sensitive firewall/proxy configuration; a deterministic
  "canonical always wins" model was chosen instead.

## Open Trade-offs

- Whether to keep the fixed six-service bundle (simple, one config to
  reason about) vs. introduce installation profiles (more flexible, more
  combinations to test) — see `docs/profiles.md`.
- Whether the `PartOf` fate-sharing model (DD-4) should be loosened for
  operator convenience at the cost of weaker failure-isolation guarantees.
- Whether to keep all logic in one file (DD-9) vs. extract embedded
  scripts into separate, independently lintable/testable files at the
  cost of a more complex deployment/packaging story.
- Whether wg-easy's host-kernel WireGuard module dependency (DD-10) is
  acceptable long-term, or worth replacing with a userspace WireGuard
  backend (`boringtun`/`wireguard-go`) that would need no kernel module at
  all — the latter needs a forked/customized image and hasn't been
  attempted.

### DD-14: The canonical bundle is published once, atomically, at the end of Stage 6 (2026-07-28)

- **Decision:** Stage 4 writes `/etc/master-stack/state.env` but does not
  publish a canonical copy or a `SHA256SUMS` manifest. The entire
  canonical bundle — `state.env` plus, when local DNS is enabled, the six
  dnsmasq/Caddy files — is published as one atomic set at the end of
  Stage 6.
- **Context:** `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` finding **M8**.
- **Rationale:** `canonical_bundle_ok()` validates the manifest's entry
  list *against the `LOCAL_DNS_ENABLED` value inside the canonical
  `state.env`*. Those two must therefore always become visible together.
  Publishing `state.env` in Stage 4 alongside a state.env-only manifest
  broke that invariant for the whole of Stages 4-6, and an interrupted
  re-run left reconcile hard-exiting on every cycle with no self-healing.
- **Alternatives rejected:** deleting Stage 4's manifest write alone (a
  fresh install then has no manifest, and a re-run's stale manifest no
  longer matches the newly written `state.env` — both still fail
  validation); writing the full seven-entry manifest in Stage 4
  (impossible on a fresh install, where those files don't exist yet).
- **Consequence worth knowing:** during Stages 4-6 of a re-run,
  `state_value()` still reads the *previous* run's canonical values. That
  is deliberate — for a half-applied re-run, the last known-good
  configuration is the right thing to enforce.

### DD-15: Docker's chain layout is assumed, and Docker itself is deliberately not pinned (2026-07-28)

- **Decision:** `docker-ce`/`containerd.io`/`tailscale`/`caddy` stay
  unpinned even though container images are pinned to exact tags, and the
  firewall helper keeps assuming Docker's internal chain layout
  (`DOCKER-USER`, `DOCKER-FORWARD` and `ts-forward` existing, and being
  the first three `FORWARD` rules in that order).
- **Context:** `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` finding **M9**.
- **Operational fact worth stating explicitly:** because Stage 3 leaves
  the Docker apt repository configured, **every re-run upgrades Docker to
  the newest upstream release** via Stage 1's `full-upgrade`. A re-run is
  therefore also a Docker upgrade, whether or not that was the intent.
- **Rationale for not pinning:** this host publishes ports to the public
  IPv4, so freezing Docker's version would trade a hypothetical layout
  change for a certain loss of CVE fixes. The coupling is the lesser
  risk.
- **Failure mode, for the record:** if a Docker release restructures
  those chains, `ensure_forward_prefix()` returns non-zero and `set -e`
  aborts the helper before any rule is applied. On a re-run the
  previously-applied chains survive (the staging swap only happens at the
  end), so that path fails safe. The real exposure is a **reboot** after
  such an upgrade: these rules have no persistence layer and are rebuilt
  from scratch at every boot, so a broken helper means the fail-closed
  WAN DROP and the Tailnet → Docker/LAN DROP backbone are simply never
  created.
- **Mitigation applied:** diagnostics only — the helper now names the
  missing chain and the likely cause rather than aborting silently.
  Verified live on 2026-07-28 that Docker 29.6.2 still produces exactly
  the assumed layout.
- **Known asymmetry, deliberately left alone:** `apply_ipv6()` degrades
  gracefully when Docker's IPv6 `DOCKER-USER` chain is missing (warns and
  skips the IPv6 policy), but `ensure_forward_prefix()` treats the same
  condition as fatal for either family. Changing it would loosen a
  fail-closed path, so it is recorded rather than "fixed".

### DD-16: Managed firewall rules never reference container IPs (2026-07-29)

- **Decision:** every rule the `docker-tailscale-fw` helper writes matches
  on interface names (`tailscale0`, the detected WAN interface) and *host*
  addresses (the public IPv4, the Tailscale IPv4). None of them names a
  container's bridge address.
- **Why this matters, measured 2026-07-29:** across a reboot, Docker
  assigns container bridge IPs in start order, and that order is not
  deterministic. On one boot `qbittorrent` held `172.18.0.6`; on the next
  it held `172.18.0.2`, with `filebrowser`, `sftpgo` and `portainer`
  likewise shuffled. Docker correctly rewrote all of its own DNAT and
  ACCEPT rules to match. Because our rules never mention those addresses,
  `MASTER-DOCKER`, `MASTER-TS-FORWARD` and the `FORWARD` prefix came back
  **byte-identical** while Docker's chains legitimately changed.
- **Two consequences worth keeping:**
  - `check_ipv4_policy()`/`check_ipv6_policy()` assert the exact contents
    of our chains and the ordering of the `FORWARD` prefix, but say
    nothing about the contents of Docker's `DOCKER` chain. If they did,
    `--check` would report drift after every reboot.
  - `docker_dnat_rule_exists()` in reconcile resolves the container's
    current IP at check time via `docker_network_tuple()` rather than
    comparing against a stored value. That is what lets it verify Docker's
    DNAT rules without breaking when the address changes.
- **Trade-off:** the narrow public allows are therefore expressed against
  `--ctorigdst` (the pre-DNAT destination) rather than the container, which
  is slightly less obvious to read but is the only formulation stable
  across restarts.
- **What would break this:** giving containers static bridge addresses and
  then writing rules against them. Do not — the current arrangement is why
  a reboot needs no reconciliation at all.

### DD-17: Nothing persists firewall rules to disk (2026-07-29)

- **Decision/observation:** no `iptables-persistent`, no `/etc/iptables`,
  and `nftables.service` left disabled. The complete rule set is rebuilt
  from scratch on every boot by `docker.service` (its own chains),
  `tailscaled` (`ts-*`) and `docker-tailscale-fw.service` (`MASTER-*`).
- **Confirmed 2026-07-29:** packet counters reset across a reboot, proving
  the rules are new objects rather than a restored dump, and the rebuilt
  set matches the previous one apart from Docker's container-IP churn
  (DD-16).
- **Rationale:** a persisted dump would be a second source of truth that
  could drift from `install.sh`, and would restore stale addresses at boot
  before the helpers had a chance to detect the current ones. Rebuilding
  is slower by roughly a second and always correct.
- **Consequence for failure analysis:** if the firewall helper ever fails
  to run, the host does not fall back to an older policy — it has *no*
  managed policy until the helper succeeds. That is why
  `docker-tailscale-fw.service` failing triggers reconcile via
  `OnFailure=` immediately rather than waiting for the 5-minute timer.

### DD-18: UDP socket buffer ceilings are floored by the installer, and they are a Tailscale setting — not a WireGuard one (2026-07-29)

- **Decision:** Stage 2 writes `/etc/sysctl.d/99-master-stack-netbuf.conf`
  with `net.core.rmem_max` / `wmem_max` set to
  `max(current_value, 16 MiB)`. `rmem_default` is deliberately left alone.
- **Why it was needed:** on the live host both values were already 64 MiB
  — but from `/etc/sysctl.d/99-nc-kernel.conf`, a **file shipped by the
  VPS provider's image**, not by this installer. Nothing in `install.sh`
  set them. On any host without that file they fall back to Debian's
  default of 208 KB.
- **Who actually benefits — and the mis-attribution that produced this
  entry.** This was first proposed as a *WireGuard* optimization. That was
  wrong, and measurement is what caught it. Kernel WireGuard (what
  `wg-easy` uses) attaches an `encap_rcv` callback to its UDP socket;
  `udp_queue_rcv_one_skb()` hands the packet to that callback **before**
  the socket receive queue is involved, so `rmem_max` never gates its data
  path. The evidence, taken inside the container's netns after 6.19 GiB of
  real peer traffic:

  ```
  Udp: InDatagrams 5074319 ... RcvbufErrors 0  SndbufErrors 0  MemErrors 0
  /proc/net/udp  00000000:FE93 (port 65171 = wg0)  rx_queue=00000000  drops=0
  ```

  The setting matters for **Tailscale**, which is *userspace* WireGuard
  (`wireguard-go`) and does read from a UDP socket: `tailscaled` was
  observed holding `rb14680064` (14 MiB). At Debian's 208 KB ceiling that
  request would have been clamped ~70× smaller, silently costing
  exit-node throughput. Since being a Tailscale exit-node is this host's
  primary function, the finding survived — it just changed owner.
- **Why raising a ceiling is safe here, and why the qBittorrent
  experience does not apply.** `mem_limit`/`cpus` are cgroup ceilings that
  *constrain*: hitting one takes throughput away, which is exactly what
  happened in **M1**. `rmem_max` is the opposite kind of ceiling — it
  allocates nothing and only sets the largest value a process may request
  via `setsockopt(SO_RCVBUF)`. Raising it cannot slow anything down; it
  can only stop clamping. `rmem_default` *is* applied to every socket that
  does not ask for a size, so touching that one would have raised baseline
  memory use across the system — which is why it is excluded.
- **Raise-only, never lower.** The value is computed as a `max()` against
  whatever is already in effect, so a provider that sets 64 MiB keeps it
  and a re-run is idempotent. Simulated across the Debian default, a
  provider 64 MiB, an exact-floor value, and malformed/empty input.
- **Not reconciled, and that is deliberate.** Unlike ethtool flags, a
  `sysctl.d` file survives reboots by construction — the file on disk *is*
  the guarantee, so there is nothing for a 5-minute loop to repair. This
  is the same reasoning as DD-11, applied to a setting that happens to be
  persistent rather than volatile.
- **Known limitation:** `sysctl.d` applies files in lexical order, so a
  provider file sorting after ours that sets a *lower* value would win.
  The `max()` handles the realistic case (provider sets it higher); the
  inverted case is accepted as exotic and is not defended against.
